### Hey, I'm Siri ðŸ‘‹

A 25-year-old engineer from Germany with a background in both **Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering**. I've channeled my academic knowledge into practical skills, focusing on **control systems** and building things with **open-source** tools.

My core skills include **Python** for data analysis and scripting, **MATLAB** for simulation, and **C++** for embedded systems on Arduino. I'm currently diving deep into **3D data imaging** with Python, a field I find incredibly fascinating.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new destinations around the world.

I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects involving **3D imaging**, **gaming**, and **AI**. If you have an interesting idea or project, feel free to get in touch!
