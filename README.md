### Hi there! 👋

I'm Siri, a 25-year-old engineer from Germany with a passion for **control systems** and building in the **open-source** community. My academic journey from a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering to a Master's in Biomedical Engineering has equipped me with a unique blend of analytical and practical skills.

I believe in continuous learning and applying new knowledge to real-world problems.
